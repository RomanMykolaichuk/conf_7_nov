Given the relative simplicity of the technology used in the TB2, the \\nlosses to advanced Russian air defenses are not unexpected. The balance between rela -\\ntively inexpensive and more advanced drones may prove to be the most interesting aspect \\nof Ukraine’s use of the TB2.\\nPunisher\\nIn addition to the TB2, the Ukrainian Army is using a small and nimble locally made \\ndrone known as the Punisher, which has successfully completed numerous missions \\nagainst Russian forces.23 The drone is designed and manufactured by UA Dynamics, a \\ncompany operated by veterans of the Crimea conflict. The company describes the drone \\nas “reusable, fast, unexpected, precise, lethal.”24\\nThe Punisher has a 2-kilogram (4.5 pounds) combat payload, 45-kilometer (28 miles) \\nrange, and 43-knot cruising speed. It has a 2.3-meter (6.5 feet) wingspan and can fly at \\n400 meters (1200 feet) altitude for missions of up to 90 minutes.25 Their small size and \\nlow altitude allow them to reach deep behind enemy lines with little risk of detection \\nbefore or during strikes and then return for a quick five- to- seven- minute servicing.

But based on its proven ability to develop complex air and space systems, \\nRussia is expected to master the competencies required for designing and manufacturing \\nhighly capable drones. Currently, Russia is employing domestically produced drones in \\nUkraine, which has prompted many Western companies to cease cooperating with Rus -\\nsian firms.

This drone entered the war early, and \\nRussia used it to attack Ukrainian military assets and for aerial reconnaissance and elec -\\ntronic warfare. For surveillance and reconnaissance purposes, this drone is usually used in \\na group of two or three.\\nThe first drone is used for reconnaissance at an altitude of 1–1.5 kilometers (4,000 to \\n6,000 feet) above a target; the second drone is used for electronic warfare; and the third \\ntransmits surveillance information to the control center.42 The drone has a maximum \\nspeed of 150 kilometers (90 miles) per hour and a combat range of 140 kilometers (80 \\nmiles). It can remain in flight for a maximum of 16 hours and has a service ceiling of \\n5,000 meters (15,000 feet). Its capabilities are not yet fully known but it serves in many \\nof the same capacities as the previous drones described.\\nForpost R\\nThe Forpost R is a Russian license- produced version of the Israeli IAI Searcher II \\ndrone.43 Forpost R has a maximum speed of 200 kilometers (120 miles) per hour, a mis -\\nsion endurance window of about 18 hours, and a service ceiling of 20,000 feet. This drone \\nconducted its maiden flight on August 23, 2019 and joined the Russian Armed Forces in \\n2020. The primary objective of the Forpost R is to conduct reconnaissance, and the \\n500-kilogram (1200 pounds) air vehicle is equipped with improved radar identification \\nequipment among other reconnaissance devices. On March 11, 2022, a Russian Forpost \\nR drone was destroyed by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine’s military claimed the drone crossed \\ninto Polish airspace before reentering Ukrainian airspace, where it was shot down.\\nOrion E\\nThe Orion- E combat drone is considered Russia’s best strike drone. Russian forces \\nfirst used the Orion- E in combat in Syria against forces opposing the Assad regime.44 \\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense even claimed that the drone has “fighter- like” capabilities.45\\n42. “Orlan 10 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,” Air Force Technology , March 15, 2021, https://www.airforce  \\n- technology.com/ .\\n43. “Russia Uses Forpost- R Armed Drone with Guided Missile to Destroy Rocket Launcher of Ukrai -\\nnian Army,” Army Recognition, March 13, 2022, https://www.armyrecognition.com/ .\\n44.

It can also jam other airborne radars such as radar- guided \\nmissiles. The Krasukha-4 resembles the Krasukha-2 but can also effectively disrupt low- \\nEarth orbit satellites and cause permanent damage to targeted radio- electronic devices.57 \\nThe truck- based R-330Zh Zhitel system can interfere with satellite communications \\nequipment, navigation systems, and mobile phones within a 30-kilometer (20 mile) \\n53.

Although these systems were not initially designed for counter- drone activities, \\nthey are useful if employed correctly.\\nConclusion\\nLooking back on nine months of the war in Ukraine, it is evident the TB2 and other \\ncombat drones engaged in the conflict are making a useful contribution to the war. Yet, \\nthey are unlikely to be the deciding factor against a Russian army buoyed by greater \\nmanpower and long- range artillery.58\\nStill, as a result of the apparent success of its drone force, Ukraine is not only destroy -\\ning critical targets but aiding in the degradation of morale among Russian forces. For \\nRussian soldiers already struggling to rationalize their experience in Ukraine with the \\njustification they were initially given for the war, adding the fear of attack from unseen \\ndrones only makes the anxiety of war more challenging. The fear of the unseen leads to a \\nsense of helplessness, which diminishes hope. Thus, it should be no surprise that good \\norder and discipline is often breaking down among Russian troops.59\\nThe war in Ukraine clearly demonstrates drones are altering the dynamics of war. For \\nUkraine, airpower is largely taking the form of drones, a first for a large nation. Demo -\\ncratic and authoritarian regimes like Ukraine and Russia know that military drone tech -\\nnology is quickly becoming central to warfare. Given the relative cost- effectiveness of \\ndrones—compared to similar manned aircraft—they are challenging the existing as -\\nsumptions about the use of airpower, allowing lesser adversaries to engage effectively in \\naerial warfare.\\nTurkey, the manufacturer of the most popular drone in Ukraine’s arsenal, has a defense \\nbudget that is a fraction of that of the United States. Yet the country is still managing to \\ndevelop and export highly capable and cost- effective drones. Turkey is accomplishing its \\nsuccess in the midst of a technological boycott by Western countries due to its role in \\nSyria, Libya, and Azerbaijan.60 If the first months of the war in Ukraine teach us any -\\nthing about the present and future of drones in warfare, it is that they will appeal to \\ncountries that cannot afford costly manned fighters. The war between Armenia and Azer -\\nbaijan is already an example. These same states will rely on drones and develop new tac -\\ntics, techniques, and procedures that employ them in unexpected ways. \\uf051\\uf06b\\n58.
