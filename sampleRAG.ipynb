       "'Lowther & SiddikiAIR & SPACE OPERATIONS REVIEW   5defense technologies and began to modernize the military.10 These efforts included coop -\\nerating with many Western nations to acquire state- of- the- art military hardware and \\nsoftware. In this regard, Ukraine’s homegrown military drone technology was relatively \\nyoung when Russia invaded in February 2022.11 Many drones Ukraine has deployed \\nagainst Russia were purchased from foreign nations, with Turkey leading the list of sup -\\npliers before the start of the war.\\nBaykar Bayraktar TB2\\nThe Baykar Bayraktar TB2 is a medium- altitude, long- endurance unmanned combat \\naerial vehicle that, according to the manufacturer, is capable of remotely controlled or \\nautonomous flight operations. This immensely popular drone is manufactured by the \\nTurkish defense company Baykar Defense.12 The manufacturer’s primary objective is to \\nbuild a less expensive alternative to Western drones, primarily for the Turkish Armed \\nForces. Although it is not comparable to state- of- the- art American drones like General \\nAtomics’ MQ-9 Reaper or Northrop Grumman’s RQ-4 Global Hawk, its appeal lies in a \\nbrutally efficient cost- benefit calculation on the battlefield.\\nThe TB2 can fly for almost 24 hours at a maximum altitude of 25,000 feet. It is 6.5 \\nmeters (approximately 21 feet) long with a wingspan of 12 meters (approximately 39 feet) \\nand a maximum take- off weight of 650 kilograms (1,433 pounds).13 Commonly called the \\nBayraktar, it can be equipped with four laser- guided bombs. Notably, these bombs are prov -\\ning incredibly effective against Russian tanks and other armored vehicles.14\\nBefore its appearance in Ukraine, this drone was used in Syria, Libya, and Azerbaijan.15 \\nIn 2019, the Armed Forces of Ukraine began acquiring the Bayraktar TB2S, then up -\\ngraded to the TB2 as a part of its military modernization program. 16 Outmanned, out -\\ngunned, and primarily relying on unbreakable resolve, Ukrainian forces have found this \\ndrone to be very effective as a force multiplier.17\\n10.
