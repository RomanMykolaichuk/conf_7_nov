# Conf_7_Nov: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

Conf_7_Nov is a project that demonstrates the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methodology to combine information retrieval with natural language generation. This system leverages a combination of state-of-the-art technologies to enable efficient data search and generate contextualized answers based on retrieved information. 

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines search and text generation for highly relevant, context-aware answers.
- **Language Model (Llama 3.1)**: Uses the Llama 3.1 model through Ollama for precise and cohesive text generation.
- **Vector-Based Indexing**: Efficient search and retrieval of relevant documents through embedding-based indexing.
- **Custom Embedding Generation**: Converts text data into vector representations for accurate similarity search.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook Environment**: Facilitates code execution, parameter adjustment, and real-time testing.
